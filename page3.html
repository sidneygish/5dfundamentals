	<div id="infobox">What can’t you do with a Sharpie? <p>Well, for starters, you can’t see how much ink you’ve got left. It’s always a mystery! <p>The ink is also not easily washable – it is waterproof for up to a week on skin, and it can stain materials such as fabrics forever. Be careful! <p>Its functionality is also heavily reliant on user responsibility. If a user leaves this marker uncapped for too long, they may dry it out! <p> Finally, not everyone can handle this kind of marker. If you passed these out in a kindergarten class, the kids might cause a respectable amount of property damage.
