	<div id="infobox">What can you do with a Sharpie? <p>The design of this marker affords graspability to users, regardless of dominant hand. The design calls back to centuries-old writing utensil conventions, making the technicalities present within crystal-clear. <p>This utensil affords distribution of permanent ink to users, on whatever surface they so desire. Customizability is also afforded, as this object enables creation of medium on-the-go rather than a logical pathway to any outcome or work in particular. <p>The cap present over the markerâ€™s felt tip affords control over the distribution of ink to the user. With the cap on the marker, a user can confidently throw this into their backpack with no impending issues.
